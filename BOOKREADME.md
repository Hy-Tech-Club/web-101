### Weekly Plan
Each week, follow the same type of agenda we normally would follow in class:

1. **Lecture**: watch any lecture recordings before Office Hours on Tuesday
1. **Code-Along**: watch any code-along recordings before Office Hours, OR start watching when Office Hours start so you can ask the instructors questions as you complete the activity
1. **Individual Exercises**: work on the individual exercises during Office Hours and ask the instructors questions as you complete the activities, OR complete the activities before Office Hours and login to Zoom to ask your questions
1. **Challenges**: work on the challenges after completing the code-along
