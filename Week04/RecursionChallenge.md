# Recursion Challenges
[Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. Complete the following challenges that use the concept of recursion.

## `iframe` Recursion
Create a new HTML file that has an `iframe`. The `src` of the `iframe` should be _another_ new HTML file that _also_ has an `iframe`. The `src` for the `iframe` in the second file should be _yet another_ new HTML file. That file should have an `iframe` where the `src` is the _original_ HTML file.

It should look something like this:

Try to add more layers and more `iframes` within the layers!

## `table`s in `table`s
Create a table that contains a table that contains a table that contains a table that contains a table that contains a table that contains a table that contains a table (and so on).

It should look something like this:

Try changing the colors of the table cells, the number of rows, or anything else to make it look interesting!
