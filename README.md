## General Class Flow
### Warmup
_A time-bound activity for students to work on individually before class starts_

- Can be a few different problems, starting easy and becoming more challenging
- Can be a question to make them start thinking about the sessions' content
- Used to refresh students' memory as well as tease new content

### Review
_A refresher on previously-covered material_

- Can use Kahoots
- Can use other games like Jeopardy
- Can go over Individual Exercises/Challenges from last week

### Lecture
_Presentation (using PowerPoint) containing content for this week_

- Examples in a TryIt Editor or CodePen should accompany each lecture
- Focus here is to familiarize students with concepts, but they probably wonâ€™t grasp them fully

### Group Activities
_Instructor-led activities that should engage students_

- Generally, there is a Follow-Along Coding activity, where the instructor should ask for suggestions from students
- Can also use Kahoots/other games to reinforce concepts from the Lecture

### Individual Exercises
_Exercises for students to work on independently_

- Students can ask for help from their peers or from instructors
- During these exercises, instructors should give one-on-one assistance to students
- If students are way ahead of the class, instructors can ask them to help slower students

### Challenge
_Activities for the students to work on if they finish the Individual Exercises_

- Every student is not expected to complete the challenge
- Instructors should encourage students to work on the challenge outside of class
- Mostly designed for the students who are ahead of the rest of the class
