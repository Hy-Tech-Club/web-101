# Challenge: Reverse Engineering a Webpage
You should have access to the image of a webpage. Your goal is to replicate the webpage using HTML! Start by creating and saving a new HTML file. Then, start adding the necessary code to create your webpage!

## Helpful Resources

- The Dunder Mifflin locations map is here: https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1DePJ8wyXW96_ZXB148HDNiZqnSw
  - Use an `iframe` to show this map on the page

## Bonus Challenges
1. Create a separate HTML page for the job application, and link to it from the main page
1. Create a "Hiring Manager" column in the data table link to the wikipedia page for each manager
    - Make up the names of any hiring managers you choose

## Extra Bonus Challenge
If you finish the Bonus Challenge, create your own profile pages for each of the managers, and link to those instead of the wiki pages. Their pages should include their name, their picture, their position in the company, and whatever else you think is necessary!
