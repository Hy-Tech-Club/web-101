## Overview: HTML Introduction
For the first week of the club, focus mainly on developing classroom culture/icebreakers/preliminary stuff.

## Ice Breakers
### Candy Introductions
Each student takes two pieces of candy (there should be a variety), but they are NOT allowed to eat it yet. Once every student has their candy, reveal that each type of candy corresponds to a question they will have to answer! These questions can be:

- Favorite Movie
- Favorite Musical Artist
- Favorite School Subject
- Favorite Vacation Destination
- Favorite TV Show

Or anything like that. Go around the room and have each student answer their questions.

### Two Truths and a Lie
Go around the room and have each student say three "facts" about themselves. One of the facts must not be true. Have the other students attempt to guess which is the lie. If the current student fools all the other students, they can receive candy.

### Snowball Fight
_This icebreaker activity works best with a large space in which to run around_

Each student starts with a piece of paper. They write down a question on the paper, then crumple it up into a ball. After that, students all throw the "snowballs" at each other until an instructor calls time. Then, each student has to answer the question on the snowball closest to them!

## Other class items
### Kahoot
Most of the students will probably have seen Kahoot already. However, it's still worth introducing them to it within this classroom context.

There is a practice Kahoot that's just trivia (some relevant, some irrelevant): https://play.kahoot.it/#/?quizId=77c21df4-9918-45a7-9542-c7b7f168c1de

### HelloHtml: Introduction to the Web
Present the HelloHTML PowerPoint

### Basic Visual Studio Code/Windows demo
- Getting files to work on
- Opening VSCode
- Opening their folder in VSCode
- Opening a file to edit
- Saving a file
- Opening a file in the browser (Reveal In Explorer)
- Refreshing the browser after file edits to see changes
- Make sure to emphasize keyboard shortcuts, many of the students arenâ€™t very familiar with computers and development environments, so it is important that they understand the fundamentals of actually writing code to make things go smoothly.

### Tools
Introduce some of the tools we will use throughout the semester, including:
- Visual Studio Code
- Google Chrome (have the students set the default Browser to Chrome)
