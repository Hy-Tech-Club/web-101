# Hello HTML: Challenge
Create a webpage that tells a story using a number of paragraphs.

## Setup
1. Create a new HTML file named **Story.html**
1. In the new HTML file, add the `<html></html>` opening and closing tag
1. Between the `<html>` and `</html>`, add the `<body></body>` opening and closing tag
1. Between the `<body>` and `</body>`, add a `<p></p>` paragraph tag that says "Once upon a time..."
1. Open up the **Story.html** file in a web browser to make sure your page is working!

## Continuing the Story
Add a few additional `<p></p>` paragraph tags that tell a story. These should include:

- The beginning of the story
- The middle of the story
- The end of the story

Try to make the story as detailed as possible!
