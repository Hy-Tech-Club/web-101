# Hello HTML: Challenge
Create a webpage that tells a story using a number of paragraphs. Start from an empty Repl project ([instructions here](ReplitIntroduction.md)), and then add some code to create the story. Refer back to the PowerPoint presentation for help!

## Setup
Once the Repl project has been forked, there is some basic code to add.

1. Open the **index.html** file for editing
1. Make a new line, and add `<html>`
    - This is the _opening `html` tag_
1. Under that, make a couple more new lines, and add `</html>`
    - This is the _closing `html` tag_
1. Between the `<html>` and `</html>`, add the `<body>` opening tag
1. Under the `<body>`, above the `</html>`, add the `</body>` closing tag
1. Between the `<body>` and `</body>`, add a `<p></p>` paragraph tag that says "Once upon a time..."
1. Click the "Run" button to make sure the story appears on the page!

## Continuing the Story
Add a few additional lines that tell a story. These should include:

- The beginning of the story
- The middle of the story
- The end of the story

Try to make the story as detailed as possible!

### Tips
For each new line in the story, there should be a new `p` element in between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags.

Make sure to add the opening tag `<p>` and closing tag `</p>`, with the text inside.
