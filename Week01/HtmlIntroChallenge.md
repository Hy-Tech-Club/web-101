# Hello HTML: Challenge
Create a webpage that tells a story using a number of paragraphs. Start from [this empty Repl](https://repl.it/@JosephMaxwell/EmptyWeb#index.html), and then follow the instructions below.

## Setup
1. In the **index.html** HTML file, add the `<html></html>` opening and closing tag
1. Between the `<html>` and `</html>`, add the `<body></body>` opening and closing tag
1. Between the `<body>` and `</body>`, add a `<p></p>` paragraph tag that says "Once upon a time..."
1. Click the **Run** button to make sure the story appears on the page!

## Continuing the Story
Add a few additional `<p></p>` paragraph tags that tell a story. These should include:

- The beginning of the story
- The middle of the story
- The end of the story

Try to make the story as detailed as possible!
