# Week 9 Overview: Transitions & Transforms
Introduce some more fun advanced CSS in transitions and transforms. These topics go beyond the core uses of CSS into more exciting and creative territory. CSS can be a powerful tool for creating immersive, aesthetically-pleasing, artistic experiences.

## Virtual Note
For a virtual 11-week semester, week 9 should be the final project introduction week. However, students should also feel free to learn about transitions and transforms on their own.
